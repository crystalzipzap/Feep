# Feep - A Google Keep Clone (It's a fake Keep, so Feep xD)

This project is a fun journey to create a full-stack clone of Google Keep, a popular note-taking app. It's an ongoing endeavor that serves not just as a cloning attempt but as a learning platform for various aspects of web application development (and maybe app dev later too).

I'm all in for embracing the process of learning through trial and error. This project is more than just coding; it's about documenting the journey, tracking relevant notes and links. Will update as I go.

## Tech Stacks

- Backend: Node.js with TypeScript and Express.
- Database: Currently using MongoDB, but eyeing Postgres.
- Frontend: Building with React, TypeScript, and BootStrap
- Testing and Debugging (Sanity Assurance): Postman for ensuring everything is in check.
- Version Control: Git with attempts of good practice (Make branches, never push to Main, and so on)

## What's Implemented

- CRUD Operations: Ability to create, update, and delete notes.
- Basic Authentication: Implemented signup and login features using express sessions.
- UI: It's basic, functional, and minimalist for now.
- Database: functional MongoDB with Schemas defined in the Backend

## Ideas for the Future

- Authentication Update: Plan to transition from express-session to JWTs.
- OAuth Integration: Looking into using passport.js for OAuth capabilities.
- Database Migration: Migrating testing users and their world-greeting notes from MongoDB to a local PostgreSQL database.
- ORM Exploration: Considering Sequelize for improved API functionality.
- UI Overhaul: Trying to be a good clone in the future.
- Testing Cases: Time to brush off some Jest
